# Optimal Bread Slicing

Setting out to optimally slice bread has been a tedious yet fruitful endeavor. Once we found an incredible solution, we sought to share our insights the ways we knew how. The original paper can be found [here](https://ronikbhaskar.github.io/projects/optimal_slicing.pdf). The video explanation on YouTube can be found [here](https://youtu.be/R6SYxpiGGJ0?si=Ipt-r0DK1HKfHJa3). After much anticipation, we have finally created a website that calculates the optimal bread slicing angle, providing a clear visual aide. Happy slicing!

## From the Paper

While countless* branches of mathematics abstract real-world phenomena to explore richer understandings, the same has yet to be done for slicing bread. For 95 years, sliced bread has remained a phenomenon investigated empirically by bakers and food engineers. Expanding sliced bread to mathematics, we present a formal construction of bread slicing. From there, we offer straightforward utility functions to optimize various aspects of bread slicing. The vast majority of this work follows intuitively from real-world bread, and most proofs in this work are proof sketches, since full proofs would distract from the important contributions of this work.
